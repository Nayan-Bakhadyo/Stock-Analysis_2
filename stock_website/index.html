Similarly, the minute hand, establishing balance between the second hand and hour hand, represents the fixed deposit interest rate which is decided on the basis of demand and supply of loan in the economy. Thirdly, the second hand that moves in the fastest pace can be regarded as non-convertible debenture that provides highest return. Finally, the clock symbolizes the financial system of our economy. Besides, the clock also symbolizes how time has changed and investors can be in benefit by choosing other types of investment products. Investors usually prefer higher return from the invested capital. Until few years ago, investors had limited alternative between fixed deposit and equity shares to invest their capital. The later involved high amount of risk whereas the former provided lower return. The era of non-convertible debenture began however; most of these debentures did not stand to the expectation of investors. The main feature of non-convertible debentures is higher return. If we analyze the current situation, the average interest rate provided by commercial banks in FD is 8.92%. Similarly, the average interest rate provided in fixed deposits for last 10 years is 7% approx. Besides, the NEPSE 25 years historical CAGR is 11% approx along with the risk that equity investment possess. However, the newly issued and issuing debentures provide return of around 10% or more. This shows that debentures can be a good purchase to investors. The table provides detailed information on current return provided by fixed deposits, NEPSE and debentures: What are the major benefits of debentures over fixed deposits? One of the major benefits of debentures over fixed deposits is the higher return that debenture provides.

The program, attended by Minister Basnet on the 4th of Baisakh, addressed the 'Opportunities, Problems, and Challenges from Hydropower Projects of Dolakha', resulting in seven key points of discussion. Among the decisions made during the program, a notable focus was placed on initiatives to alleviate the burden of loan interest for investors in the Upper Tamakoshi project. Notably, entities such as the Employee Provident Fund, Nepal Telecom, Citizen Investment Fund, and Insurance Institute have significant investments in the Tamakosi endeavor. However, despite substantial indigenous investment, which has attracted over 800,000 investors, concerns persist regarding the project's Power Purchase Agreement. In contrast to similar hydropower projects aligned with the Nepal Electricity Authority, where unit prices soar to 4.80 rupees during the wet season and 8.40 rupees in the dry season, the Upper Tamakosi project presents a stark departure with substantially lower rates. Here, rates dwindle to just Rs. 3 during the wet season and Rs. 4 during the dry season.

The project currently generates 3200 kilowatts of electricity and plans to utilize excess water during the rainy season for hydrogen production. This green hydrogen will be stored using scientific methods and could potentially be used for purposes such as cold storage. The move follows a visit by the company's president, Purna Lal Shrestha, to Japan, where he was inspired by advancements in green hydrogen production and transport. Kathmandu University has established a hydrogen refueling center in collaboration with several partners, including the Nepal Oil Corporation and Hyundai. This center, which currently produces two kilograms of hydrogen daily, aims to facilitate research and demonstrate hydrogen production and usage, supported by a significant financial contribution from the corporation.

Proposed Dividend is the dividends that are distributed among the shareholders of the company during a financial year and will be paid in the Next Year. Hence, the dividends of last FY-79/80 are distributed in this FY 80/81. Investors do not just earn from the rise in the share price of their portfolio stocks. They also earn from the dividends and bonuses announced by the company from time to time. Hence, it becomes important for secondary market enthusiasts to know the names of stocks that are going to pay dividends in the near future. The book closure date marks when a company finalizes its books for dividend distribution. While investors can purchase shares after this date, they won't receive dividends. To qualify for the company's dividend, one needs to buy shares before the book closure date and hold onto them until that date. For instance, buying shares on the day preceding the book closure still grants eligibility for the dividend, even if the shares are sold on the closure date. Commercial Banks 10 commercial banks have already proposed the dividend for the fiscal year 2079/80. Among them, NIC Asia Bank has proposed the highest dividend, i.e. 30.52%.

Nabil Bank has proposed the highest dividend, i.e. 38%. As of now, Sunrise Bank has paid the least, i.e. 7%. The book closure date for dividends of five of these companies has already elapsed, meaning investors won't be able to claim the dividend of these companies. Meanwhile, other banks have yet to declare their book closure dates, and investors can buy the shares of these companies anytime before the book closure date to be eligible for the dividend. Note for Beginners: You can buy the shares of a company after it has proposed its dividend and still be eligible to get the dividend. In other words, you do not have to invest in the company for one whole fiscal year, which is a misconception among amateur investors. The book closure date is simply the date on which the company closes its books for the dividend. Investors can still buy the shares after that date but they won\u2019t get the dividend. To get the dividend of the company, you must buy the shares before the book closure date and you must not sell those shares till the book closure date. For example, investors can buy the shares of a company on the last day before its book closure date and still be entitled to the dividend. The investor remains eligible even if they sell the shares at the book closure date. S.N.

The meeting of the commission held on Ashwin 06 approved the directive. In the directive, the commission has specified various conditions and made arrangements for the rights issuance by hydropower companies, opening the path for the companies to issue rights shares for new projects and projects under construction. If a company establishes a subsidiary company with 51 percent or more ownership as the parent company, the way is open to issuing up to 200 percent of right shares. The parent company must have started commercial production of electricity from its project. Similarly, the power purchase agreement should have been completed and the project must have the power generation license. Furthermore, the parent company should be a company listed in the stock market of Nepal. Meanwhile, a company other than the parent company may also issue right shares for the purpose of investing for less than 50% ownership in the project being constructed or going to be constructed. However, the physical progress of the construction of the project should have been more than 25% while issuing shares in this way. At most 100% rights shares can be issued for this purpose. In case of rights issuance from one's subsidiary company or from a project under construction, the monetary amount collected via the rights shares issued earlier should have been fully spent on the construction of the project. Similarly, hydropower companies can issue the right shares to complete the remaining construction work of the project in case it can't be completed with initial resources. But for this, the cost of project construction has to have gone higher than the company can bear due to uncontrollable circumstances. Uncontrollable conditions include disasters caused by natural disasters, epidemics, wars, internal rebellions, shutdowns, strike", "published_date": "2021-09-27 00:00:00", "sentiment_score": -0.38349891774891776, "sentiment_label": "NEUTRAL"}, {"title": "While the Hydro Frenzy is at its Highest, Hydropower Sector's Regulator Issues a Note of Caution", "url": "https://www.sharesansar.com/newsdetail/while-the-hydro-frenzy-is-at-its-highest-hydropower-sectors-regulator-issues-a-note-of-caution-2021-08-19", "content": "The Electricity Regulatory Commission's attention has been drawn to news circulated across platforms that the promoters of hydropower companies have caused unnatural stock price hikes in shares of hydropower companies. The commission states that it is a normal principle of the capital market that an investor should only invest in companies that have sound financials. Thus, it is the responsibility of companies listed on the exchange to unveil accurate information. The commission has stated that it will take strict action against any hydropower company unveiling incorrect financial reports with the hidden intent to mislead investors. The Electricity Regulatory Commission has requested shareholders to invest in hydropower companies after properly ascertaining their technical and fundamental health, and correctly anticipating the expected returns. Since investors have varying investment strategies, the commission has requested investors to have a risk management strategy according to their respective strategies. Furthermore, the commission has also clarified that no decision has been taken so far on allowing the companies to issue the right shares to repay the loan of the project. The commission has stated that only the draft of the revised directive has been made public so far. Thus, the provisions mentioned in the draft may or may not be included in the final guideline. The Electricity Regulatory Commission has unveiled a checklist to ensure the financial health of hydropower companies.

Sharma personally met with the taskforce chairperson, Rewat Bahadur Karki, and executive director, Guru Prasad Paudel, at Nepal Rastra Bank on Sunday to submit the recommendations. The proposal emphasizes the need for a structured three-year reform roadmap for the microfinance industry, underlining that quick fixes will not suffice to resolve the sector\u2019s challenges. It calls for interest rate regulation through the introduction of a Microfinance Annual Percentage Rate (MAPR), institutional mergers to reduce fragmentation, borrower education programs, and a review of rural financial models to ensure sustainability and social empowerment. Sharma highlighted that although microfinance institutions were initially established to expand financial access to low-income communities, many of these institutions now face severe financial difficulties. This crisis has triggered dissatisfaction and distrust among members, employees, and shareholders, posing risks to the stability of the entire financial system. Key recommendations in the proposal include the establishment of clear guidelines for loan restructuring, partial loan forgiveness programs targeting vulnerable borrowers, and streamlined loan settlement arrangements offering concessions on outstanding debts. It also advocates forming dedicated \u201cRisk Asset Management Units\u201d within microfinance institutions to oversee loan recovery and restructuring efforts.
